# Shapefile utility packages

| Language  | Package  | Last Updated  | Thoughts  | 
| ---       | ---   | :---          | :---      |
| R | [tigris](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tigris/tigris.pdf) | 2022-06-03 | I'm not as familiar with R, but it looks like the last commit was very recent and the documentation is excellent. | 
| Python | [census-shapefile-utils](https://github.com/censusreporter/census-shapefile-utils) | 2016-01-21 | Older, but it seems like it is calling on the right FTP structures |
